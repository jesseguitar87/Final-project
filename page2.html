    On November 12, 1993 the first ever UFC event was held. It was an 8 man martial arts tournament with no rules, time limits or weight classes. Martial artists from arts such as boxing, kickboxing, sumo and Taekwondo all competed. All of the men were well over 200 pounds each, and would be considered heavyweights, except Royce Gracie, the smallest man there at 170 pounds. Royce proceeded to defeat 3 larger opponents in a row, winning UFC 1 and proving the power that Brazilian Jiu Jitsu held.
